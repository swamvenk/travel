	- ## [[Day4 - Nov27]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### **Osaka -> Koyasan**
		- This is not covered in JRPass
		- Koyasan is most conveniently accessed by Nankai Railway from Osaka's Namba or Shin-Imamiya stations. Take the Nankai Koya Line from either station to the Gokurakubashi terminal station. A few limited express trains operate directly to Gokurakubashi (80 minutes, 1720 yen, every 1-3 hours). Otherwise take an express or rapid express train (100 minutes, 930 yen, every 20-30 minutes), most of which require a transfer at Hashimoto Station along the way.
		- At Gokurakubashi, transfer to the cablecar which travels up the mountain to Koyasan. The ride takes about five minutes and costs 500 yen. From the top station, it is a ten minute bus ride into the town center (300 yen to Senjuinbashi bus stop). Note that it is not permitted to walk along the street which connects the cablecar station with the town center.
		- ![Route to Koyasan](https://www.japan-guide.com/g2/4900_map_osaka.gif)
		- To save money consider using the [Koyasan World Heritage Ticket](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2358_012.html) or [Kansai Thru Pass](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2357_005.html).
		- Main attraction is **Okunoin temple** but there are a few places to also see
			- The town of Koyasan is relatively flat and many of its attractions are easily explored on foot. Most of the sites, including the Garan, Kongobuji and the Reihokan Museum are located in the town center, a short walk away from the Senjuinbashi intersection. Among the main attractions, only Okunoin stands outside of the town center at the eastern end of the town. At the western end of the town stands Daimon Gate, the traditional point of entry to Koyasan.
			- ![Koyasan Town](https://www.japan-guide.com/g2/4900_map_01.gif)

		- We can return early and rest as the next day is packed
	- ## [[Day5 - Nov28]]
		- ### **Osaka -> Kyoto Day 1**
			- Tokaido Shinkansen line (15 mins)
			- Day 1 in Kyoto is packed with a lot of walking and hiking
		- ### **Tokufuji Temple**
			- ![Tokufuji](https://www.japan-guide.com/g18/3930_top.jpg)
			- In autumn, people come from all over Japan to see Tofukuji's autumn colors. The most popular view is of the Tsutenkyo Bridge, which spans a valley of lush maple trees. The view from the bridge is equally spectacular, and the 100 meter long, covered walkway becomes extremely crowded when the colors reach their peak, usually around mid to late November.
			- Tofukuji is a ten minute walk from Tofukuji Station on the JR Nara Line (2 minutes, 150 yen from Kyoto Station) and the Keihan Main Line
			- ![Tokufuji](https://www.japan-guide.com/g9/2158_south_1504.gif)
		- ### **Fushimi Inari Taisha (Senbon Torii)**
			- ![Fushimi Inari Taisha](https://www.japan-guide.com/g18/3915_top.jpg)
			- Fushimi Inari Shrine is located just outside JR Inari Station, the second station from Kyoto Station along the JR Nara Line (5 minutes, 150 yen one way from Kyoto Station, not served by rapid trains). The shrine can also be reached in a short walk from Fushimi Inari Station along the Keihan Main Line.
				- Tokufuji and Fushimi Inari are next stops. See the Route map for Tokufuji
			- The hike to the summit of the mountain and back takes about 2-3 hours, however, visitors are free to walk just as far as they wish before turning back
			- After about a 30-45 minute ascent and a gradual decrease in the density of torii gates, visitors will reach the Yotsutsuji intersection roughly half way up the mountain, where some nice views over Kyoto can be enjoyed, and the trail splits into a circular route to the summit. Many hikers only venture as far as here, as the trails do not offer much variation beyond this point and the gate density decreases further.
		- We can break for lunch for the day back at Kyoto station and then go north for Kiyomizu dera
		- ### **Kiyomizu-dera**
			- ![Kiyomizu-dera](https://www.japan-guide.com/g20/3901_01.jpg)
			- Kiyomizudera can be reached from Kyoto Station by bus number 206 (15 minutes, 230 yen). Get off at Gojo-zaka or Kiyomizu-michi bus stop, from where it is a ten minute uphill walk to the temple.
			- ![Kiyomizu-dera](https://www.japan-guide.com/g19/2158_east_1911.gif)
		- ### **Hagashiyama district**
			- Preserved historic district around Kiyomizudera
			- It is a great place to experience traditional old Kyoto, especially between Kiyomizudera and Yasaka Shrine, where the narrow lanes, wooden buildings and traditional merchant shops invoke a feeling of the old capital city.
			- District between Kiyomizudera and Yasaka Shrine is only about two kilometers long and could be done in half an hour
			- Good walkers are likely to enjoy walking beyond Yasaka Shrine past Chionin and Shorenin to Heian Shrine and possibly as far as Ginkakuji Temple via Nanzenji and the Philosopher's Path.
				- Kiyomizu-dera to Ginkakuji will be 1 hour walk
					- ![google_maps_walk.png](../assets/image_1699454005800_0.png)
				- **Ginkakuji** is the Silver Pavilion corresponding to Kinkajuji (Golden Pavilion) we will visit the next day
					- ![Ginkakuji](https://www.japan-guide.com/g19/3907_01.jpg)
				- **Philosopher's path** would be beautiful with autumn leaves and colors
					- ![Philosopher's path](https://www.japan-guide.com/g18/3906_top.jpg)

	- ## [[Day6 - Nov29]]
		- ### **Osaka -> Kyoto Day 2**
		- ### **Arashiyama bamboo forest**
			- Should target early morning to avoid crowd and return back to Arashiyama for Lunch
			- The fastest access from Kyoto Station to Arashiyama is provided by the JR Sagano Line (also known as JR Sanin Line included in JRPass). The one way ride to Saga-Arashiyama Station takes 15 minutes and costs 240 yen. From the station it is a 5-10 minute walk to central Arashiyama.
			- ![](https://www.japan-guide.com/g19/2158_west_1903.gif)
			- https://www.japan-guide.com/g19/2158_west_1903.gif
			- The Togetsukyo Bridge is Arashiyama's well known, central landmark. Many small shops, restaurants and other attractions are found nearby, including Tenryuji Temple, Arashiyama's famous bamboo groves and pleasure boats that are available for rent on the river.
			- Arashiyama becomes most attractive (and busy) around early April and the second half of November when the cherry blossom and fall color seasons usually peak
		- ### **Sagano romantic train - Hozu River Boat Tour**
			- The Sagano Scenic Railway (嵯峨野観光鉄道, also known as the Sagano Romantic Train or Sagano Torokko) is a sightseeing train line that runs along the Hozugawa River between Arashiyama and Kameoka. Its charming, old-fashioned trains wind their way through the mountains at a slow pace, taking about 25 minutes to make the seven kilometer journey and giving passengers pleasant views of the scenery as they travel from Arashiyama through the forested ravine and into rural Kameoka.
			- The train is particularly popular during the autumn color season from mid November to early December when the leaves along the ravine change color.
			- Tickets can be purchased at Torokko Saga Station or at JR ticket offices in the Kansai Region or online through Klook
			- Travelers combine the sightseeing train with a Hozugawa River Cruise back to Arashiyama
			- The boats take about two hours to leisurely make their way down the river and are a relaxing way to see the natural scenery of the largely undeveloped ravine.
			- Can buy the cruise ticket on Klook as well

			- ![](https://www.japan-guide.com/g18/3908_top.jpg)
			- https://www.japan-guide.com/g18/3908_top.jpg
			- Kinkakuji can be accessed from Kyoto Station by direct Kyoto City Bus number 205 in about 40 minutes and for 230 yen. Alternatively, it can be faster and more reliable to take the Karasuma Subway Line to Kitaoji Station (15 minutes, 260 yen) and a taxi (10 minutes, about 1300 yen) or bus (10 minutes, 230 yen, bus numbers 204 or 205) from there to Kinkakuji.

				- But we need to reach Kintetsu Nara Station for a close walk to the Park
